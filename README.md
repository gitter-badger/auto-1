A collection of source code generators for [Java][java].

Autoâ€½
-----

[Java][java] is full of code that is mechanical, repetitive, typically untested and sometimes the source of subtle bugs. _Sounds like a job for robots!_

The Auto subprojects are a collection of code generators that automate those types of tasks. They create the code you would have written, but without the bugs.

Save time.  Save code.  Save sanity.
